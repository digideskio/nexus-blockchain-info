# nexus-blockchain-info

Blockchain.info gateway for ip.nexus

# Install

**First Step**

Included in the package of this mod is a folder called Upload, upload the contents of this folder to your forums corresponding folders keeping the folders structure intact.
NOTE: If you have renamed your admin folder to something else (for example: myadminarea) and the upload directory of this mod contains a folder called admin,
you need to rename it with the correct new name before uploading it. So following the example above you need to rename the folder admin to myadminarea. 

**Second Step**

Log in to your IP.Board Admin CP and visit the System tab -> Applications & Modules -> Manage Hooks page.
In the 'Install a New Hook' section, browse to the XML file included with these instructions and click Open.
Once it installs this hook, be sure to enable it! 

**Final Step**

Now you can make a gateway, visit Admin Cp -> Nexus Application -> Store Settings -> Payment Gateways, then add a BCI Gateway.
